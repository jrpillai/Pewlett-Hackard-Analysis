-- Retrieve the emp_no, first_name, and last_name columns from the Employees table.
-- Retrieve the title, from_date, and to_date columns from the Titles table.
-- Create a new table using the INTO clause.
-- Join both tables on the primary key.
-- Filter the data on the birth_date column to retrieve the employees who were born between 1952 and 1955. Then, order by the employee number.
-- Export the Retirement Titles table from the previous step as retirement_titles.csv and save it to your Data folder in the Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis folder.

-- Use Distinct with Order By to remove duplicate rows
-- Exclude those employees that have already left the company by filtering on to_date to keep only those dates that are equal to '9999-01-01'.

-- Write another query in the Employee_Database_challenge.sql file to retrieve the number of employees by their most recent job title who are about to retire.
-- First, retrieve the number of titles from the Unique Titles table.
-- Then, create a Retiring Titles table to hold the required information.
-- Group the table by title, then sort the count column in descending order.
