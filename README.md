# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis: Preparing a Mentorship  Program

## Overview

As Hewlett Packard prepares for the retirement of many senior employees (the "silver tsunami") you've asked me to prepare a report using SQL to help guide the creation of a mentorship program for new employees. In this report, I will determine the number of retiing employees per job title, identify employees who are eligibile to participate in a mentorship program.

## Results
Using SQL, I was able to join and filter tables to provide a list of the the job titles that are set to retire soon. In addition, I was able to provide a list of employees that are set to retire. See examples of data output below:

How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?
Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
